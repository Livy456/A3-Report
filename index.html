			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>
			<p><strong>Question:</strong> How does age and time period affect the distribution of gender?</p>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>My motivation behind generating this sketch is to show how the number of females and males changes in 1900 and 2000. Additionally, I wanted to see how the age demographic affects the number of males and females.</li>
				<li>I was hoping to communicate the stark difference between the number of females and males in 1900 vs 2000. In this sketch I wanted to overly all the data, and show that the number of females and males in 2000 exceeds the number of females and males in 1900 by a substantial amount. Additionally, the coloring of each line changes based on the size of the population for that time period and gender. For instance, at age range 30 to 34, the first portion of the line is a grey color, then dark grey, then pink, and then blue. This indicates that women from 1900 represented the smallest population size for 30 to 34 year olds, and men from 2000 represented the largest population size for 30 to 34 year olds.</li>
				<li>The pink, blue, dark grey, grey, and light grey color choices worked well in the visualization to distinguish between gender and time period. Additionally, utilizing a colored line to each data point, removed the white space in between the data points for the different years. Also, it clearly communicates which year and gender demographic are greater.</li>
				<li>In the next sketch I want to explore how the number of females differs from the number of males in 1900 vs 2000. I want to explore if there are specific age ranges in which the number of females in the population is greater than the number of males in the population. </li>
			</ul>

				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The motivation behind generating this sketch is to show the number of females and males in 1900 and 2000. I was motivated to be more creative in showing the contrast between the distribution of gender for the different years. 				</li>
				<li>The reason why I chose to make a scatter plot was to show the distinct points for the female and male population in both 1900 and 2000. I was hoping to communicate the change in the female population size in 2000 vs the male population in 2000. I wanted to communicate that at different ages the female population size is greater than the male population size and vice versa. Additionally, I wanted to convey that the male population size in 1900 is predominantly greater than the female population size in 1900 excluding ages 20 to 24 and 80 to 89 years old. I did additional research and wanted to communicate that men had a mandatory draft to be enlisted in war and this potentially contributed to the shift in more women in the population in 1900. Additionally, the medical conditions in 1900 were worse than in 2000 and this could potentially contribute to the lower average population size in 1900.</li>
				<li>In the next sketch I want to explore how the average population size has changed from 1900 to 2000. I want to build upon my design choice to draw unique marks, and explore how the visualization looks with objects relevant to that time period.</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>

				<figcaption>
					A graph to visualize the difference in average population size in 1900 and 2000. Unique marks for the data points are used to show the change in the age as the population size changes.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>My motivation behind generating this sketch is to show how the average population size in 1900 was less than the average population size in 2000. Moreover, I wanted to be more creative in the way I draw the data points to add to the interpretation of the data visualization.				</li>
				<li>I was hoping to communicate why the average population size in 1900 was less than the average population size in 2000. Moreover, I wanted to create unique icons to show that as the population ages the average population size decreases.</li>
				<li>Changing the size of the icon to indicate that the male and female population size are further apart did not work well. This is because it added an unnecessary level of complexity to the visualization that fosters confusion instead of additional insight. Changing the marks for the visualization and drawing a line connecting them worked well. </li>
				<li>In my final static visualization I would like to explore using simpler marks, leaving some of the white space in the visualization, and making the graph wider. I want to explore its effects on emphasizing the contrast between the data from 1900 and 2000 for the gender demographics.</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        The first design did a great job using color to distinguish between the different features of the data- gender and the year. Additionally, it utilized a lot of the white space to communicate which gender and the year that had the greater population size. One of the weaknesses was that the first design looked like a standard graph and lacked creativity. Whereas in the second and third design, I made more creative design choices for my marks. Both the second and third design to a great job of making a more memorable visual that draws the viewers attention to the stark contrast between the data from 1900 vs 2000. A weakness of the second design is that the additional images included with the data points are not effectively explained. The audience will have to do more work to interpret the visual. A weakness for the third design is that I poorly utilized sizing for each mark. Changing the size of the icon to indicate that the male and female population size are further apart adding additional confusion once I looked at the final sketch. In my final static visualization I want to explore utilizing white space to convey the contrast in the gender demographics of 1900 vs 2000. Additionally, I want to explore using different shapes for marks to distinguish between the features in the data.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
			I decided to incorporate the design choice from visualization 2, where I had more white space in the visualization to emphasize the contrast between the data from 1900 and 2000. Additionally, I included the design choice to make the male data points blue and the female data points pink. I wanted to more effectively visualize the contrast between the two years by keeping the same color for the male and female data points in 1900. Now the audience can more clearly see how the number of women and the number of men differ in 1900 vs 2000. We can see that the population size for men and women drastically increased from 1900 to 2000. However, I decided to not use unique marks for the data points like sketch two and three. Initially, I tried to use traditional icons for male and females, but the icons would overlap and it was hard to distinguish between the different data points. In order to distinguish the years I utilized a diamond and circle shape mark to signify data points for the year 1900 and the year 2000, respectively. I chose to use shapes instead of icons to have a simple design that does not distract the audience from the message I was trying to convey. I am trying to convey to the audience that the population size and life expectancy in 1900 is drastically less than the population size and life expectancy in 2000. Moreover, I utilized the colors pink and blue to allow the audience to see the change in distribution for the gender demographics for each year.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        When looking at the gender demographics for the year 2000, you can see that at age 35 and beyond the population size of women exceeds and remains above the population size of men. This could lead to the interpretation that women tend to live longer lives in 2000. Whereas in the lower half of the visualization we can see that in 1900 the male population size is predominantly greater than the female population size in 1900 excluding ages 20 to 24 and 80 to 89 years old. I did additional research and wanted to communicate that men had a mandatory draft to be enlisted in war and this potentially contributed to the shift in more women in the population in 1900 (The Draft). Additionally the medical conditions in 1900 were worse than in 2000, for instance “pneumonia, tuberculosis (TB), and diarrhea and enteritis caused one third of all deaths” (CDC) and there was a high infant mortality rate in 1900 (Social Security History). These contribute to the lower average population size in 1900.
